# How to create the image in perfmap_1x2.pdf

* Create the pdf files for the redundancy maps with `perfmap_fig.m`
* Drag one pdf including color bar and legend (e.g. `group1_perfmap.pdf`) into an empty InkScape svg
  * Use the Poppler/Cairo library for import
* Remove the heatmap and keep the legend and the color bar
* drag two cut-out performance maps into InkScape (e.g. `group1_perfmap_cut.pdf` and `group7_perfmap_cut.pdf`)
